# Hyperledger Composer Extension for VSCode 

Validate Composer models that define the structure of your business network 
in terms of Assets, Participants and Transactions.

This VSCode extension parses '.cto' files using the Hyperledger Composer parser
and reports any validation errors. It will also parse and validate Hyperledger
Composer 'permissions.acl' files and query files ('.qry'). To work with models 
that use imports and span multiple files, you must open all related files. 
To validate the ACL file and the query files, the corresponding model files 
must also be opened.

This extension now supports generating PlantUML diagrams from .cto files. This 
requires that the [PlantUML](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=jebbs.plantuml) extension is installed and configured before the 
diagram can be displayed. The PlantUML extension requires that [Java](https://java.com/en/download/) and [Graphviz](http://www.graphviz.org/Download..php) are also installed and in the path.

This extension is currently in beta so please raise any problems you find as an 
[issue](https://github.com/hyperledger/composer-vscode-plugin/issues).
